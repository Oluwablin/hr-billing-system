# Problem:

• An application for billing 10,000 users over a given billing API (owned by a third
party e.g. Telco/Bank).


• The billing API takes 1.6secs to process and respond to each request


• The details of the users to bill is stored in a Database with fields; id, username, 
mobile_number and amount_to_bill
